                <p>In common with many other investments, the cryptocurrency had suffered a
                    massive fall as the pandemic receded in 2022. But just as the fall was sharp, the
                    recent rise is steep, as stock markets overall have grown amid optimism over
                    declining inflation and expected interest rate drops.</p>

                <p>The value of the best-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached a new high.
                    For the first time ever one Bitcoin bought $69,202 (£54,404) on Tuesday afternoon, surpassing
                    the previous high just below $69,000 (£54,242) recorded in November 2021.
                    It comes, as the previous high did, as a 'halving' event approaches, whereby Bitcoin production
                    is cut by 50%.
                    A recent boost for the digital asset also came in January as a new product was launched that
                    allows people to track the value of Bitcoin without owning it, something known as an exchange-
                    traded fund (ETF).
                    Bitcoin values dropped slightly as the afternoon wore on, with $66,447.16 (£52,240) being
                    equal to one Bitcoin.
                    The next halving occurs on 19 April. Roughly 900 new Bitcoins are created every day, but this is
                    to be cut to 450.</p>
